## 🔒 Phase 2: Containment

### Immediate Actions (0-30 minutes)

#### Network Containment
```bash
# Block known bad IPs
iptables -A INPUT -s <ADVERSARY_IP> -j DROP
iptables -A OUTPUT -d <ADVERSARY_IP> -j DROP

# Block model download endpoints
# Add to DNS sinkhole or firewall rules
echo "<MALICIOUS_DOMAIN> 127.0.0.1" >> /etc/hosts
```

#### Endpoint Isolation
```powershell
# Windows - Isolate endpoint
New-NetFirewallRule -DisplayName "Block All Outbound" -Direction Outbound -Action Block
New-NetFirewallRule -DisplayName "Block All Inbound" -Direction Inbound -Action Block

# Allow only IR tools
New-NetFirewallRule -DisplayName "Allow IR Tools" -Direction Outbound -Program "C:\Tools\*" -Action Allow
```

#### Process Termination
```bash
# Kill GAN-related processes
pkill -f "AttackGAN"
pkill -f "MalwareGAN" 
pkill -f "RedTeamLLM"
pkill -f "torch.*generate"

# Stop Python processes with high GPU usage
for pid in $(nvidia-smi --query-compute-apps=pid --format=csv,noheader,nounits); do
    if ps -p $pid -o comm= | grep -q python; then
        kill -TERM $pid
    fi
done
```

### Evidence Preservation (30-60 minutes)

#### Memory Capture
```bash
# Linux memory capture
insmod lime.ko "path=/tmp/memory.lime format=lime"

# Windows memory capture
winpmem.exe -o memory.raw

# Capture GPU memory if possible
nvidia-ml-py3 dump-gpu-memory > gpu_memory.dump
```

#### Disk Imaging
```bash
# Create forensic image
dd if=/dev/sda of=/mnt/evidence/disk_image.dd bs=1M conv=noerror,sync

# Hash verification
sha256sum /mnt/evidence/disk_image.dd > /mnt/evidence/disk_image.sha256
```

#### Network Evidence
```bash
# Capture network traffic
tcpdump -i any -w /tmp/gan_incident.pcap &

# Export firewall logs
iptables -L -n -v > /tmp/firewall_rules.log

# DNS query logs
tail -n 1000 /var/log/dns.log | grep -i "gan\|attack\|synthetic" > /tmp/dns_evidence.log
```

## 🔍 Phase 3: Investigation and Analysis

### Malware Analysis

#### Static Analysis
```bash
# File type identification
file suspicious_file.bin

# String analysis for GAN indicators
strings suspicious_file.bin | grep -i "gan\|torch\|attack\|synthetic"

# Entropy analysis (high entropy indicates GAN generation)
python3 -c "
import math
from collections import Counter
with open('suspicious_file.bin', 'rb') as f:
    data = f.read()
counts = Counter(data)
entropy = -sum(count/len(data) * math.log2(count/len(data)) for count in counts.values())
print(f'Entropy: {entropy:.2f}')
"

# YARA scanning
yara gan_detection_rules.yar suspicious_file.bin
```

#### Dynamic Analysis
```bash
# Sandbox analysis (isolated environment)
# Monitor for:
# - Network connections to model repositories
# - GPU utilization spikes
# - File creation patterns
# - Process injection attempts

cuckoo submit suspicious_file.bin --options="enable_gpu_monitoring=true"
```

### Network Analysis

#### Traffic Analysis
```bash
# Analyze captured traffic
wireshark gan_incident.pcap

# Extract HTTP objects
tshark -r gan_incident.pcap --export-objects http,extracted_objects/

# Look for model downloads
grep -r "\.pth\|\.pt\|\.pkl" extracted_objects/

# Analyze entropy of network payloads
python3 network_entropy_analyzer.py gan_incident.pcap
```

#### DNS Analysis
```bash
# Check for DGA domains
python3 dga_detector.py dns_evidence.log

# Look for AI infrastructure domains
grep -E "(gan|attack|synthetic|model).*\.(com|net|org)" dns_evidence.log
```

### Behavioral Analysis

#### Process Timeline
```bash
# Create process execution timeline
python3 plaso/plaso.py --source memory.raw --output timeline.csv

# Filter for AI/ML related activity
grep -i "python\|torch\|gpu\|cuda" timeline.csv
```

#### GPU Usage Analysis
```bash
# Historical GPU usage (if available)
nvidia-ml-py3 query --query-gpu=timestamp,utilization.gpu,memory.used

# Correlate with process activity
python3 correlate_gpu_processes.py
```

## 🔧 Phase 4: Eradication

### Malware Removal

#### Comprehensive Cleanup
```bash
# Remove GAN-related files
find / -name "*gan*" -type f 2>/dev/null | while read file; do
    echo "Found: $file"
    # Quarantine before deletion
    mv "$file" /quarantine/
done

# Remove model files
find / -name "*.pth" -o -name "*.pt" -o -name "*.pkl" 2>/dev/null | while read file; do
    # Check if it's a GAN model
    if strings "$file" | grep -q "generator\|discriminator\|attack"; then
        mv "$file" /quarantine/
    fi
done

# Clear Python cache that might contain GAN code
find / -name "__pycache__" -type d -exec rm -rf {} + 2>/dev/null
find / -name "*.pyc" -type f -delete 2>/dev/null
```

#### Registry Cleanup (Windows)
```powershell
# Remove GAN-related registry entries
Get-ChildItem -Path "HKLM:\SOFTWARE" -Recurse | Where-Object {
    $_.Name -match "gan|attack|synthetic"
} | Remove-Item -Recurse -Force

# Remove suspicious autostart entries
Get-WmiObject Win32_StartupCommand | Where-Object {
    $_.Command -match "python.*gan|torch.*attack"
} | ForEach-Object { 
    Write-Host "Removing: $($_.Command)"
    Remove-ItemProperty -Path $_.Location -Name $_.Caption
}
```

### Network Cleanup

#### Firewall Rules
```bash
# Block known bad domains
echo "127.0.0.1 gan-cyber-range.com" >> /etc/hosts
echo "127.0.0.1 attack-generator.net" >> /etc/hosts
echo "127.0.0.1 synthetic-malware.org" >> /etc/hosts

# Update firewall rules
iptables -A OUTPUT -d gan-infrastructure-ip -j DROP
iptables-save > /etc/iptables/rules.v4
```

#### DNS Filtering
```bash
# Update DNS filters
echo "gan-cyber-range.com" >> /etc/pi-hole/blacklist.txt
pihole -g  # Reload gravity list
```

## 🔄 Phase 5: Recovery

### System Restoration

#### Safe Rebuild Process
1. **Backup Critical Data**
   ```bash
   # Backup user data (scan first)
   clamscan -r /home/user/documents/
   tar -czf user_data_backup.tar.gz /home/user/documents/
   ```

2. **OS Reinstallation** (Recommended for critical systems)
   - Format and reinstall operating system
   - Restore data from clean backups
   - Apply latest security patches

3. **Alternative: Deep Cleaning**
   ```bash
   # Full system scan
   clamscan -r --remove /
   
   # Check system integrity
   debsums -c  # Debian/Ubuntu
   rpm -Va     # RHEL/CentOS
   
   # Update all packages
   apt update && apt upgrade -y  # Debian/Ubuntu
   yum update -y                 # RHEL/CentOS
   ```

### Security Hardening

#### Endpoint Protection
```bash
# Install advanced endpoint protection
# Configure behavioral analysis
# Enable GPU monitoring

# Restrict Python execution
echo 'python: ALL' >> /etc/hosts.deny
# Or use application whitelisting

# Monitor for AI/ML framework installations
auditctl -w /usr/local/lib/python3.*/site-packages/torch -p wa -k ml_framework
```

#### Network Monitoring
```bash
# Deploy additional network monitoring
# Configure for high-entropy traffic detection
# Set up ML-based anomaly detection

# Suricata rules for GAN detection
cp detection_rules/suricata_rules.rules /etc/suricata/rules/
suricata-update
systemctl restart suricata
```
